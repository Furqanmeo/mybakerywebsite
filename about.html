<b><i>Cakes</i></b>
<p><i>A dedicated photo zone should be there with proper branding i.e. logo, tagline and images relevant to baked products should be kept. You can insist the customers to click the images with cakes and the chef and give it to them as a memory. You can also ask them to post the same on social media.1 Cakes are baked from a batter. Batter is made by mixing wet ingredients (like milk and eggs) with dry ingredients (like sugar and flour). The batter is baked in an oven. This way of baking is known as the muffin method, because muffins are made this way.</i></p>

<br>
<b><i>Butter</i></b>
<p><i>Ghee is made by melting regular butter. The butter separates into liquid fats and milk solids. Once separated, the milk solids are removed, which means that ghee has less lactose than butter. Traditionally, ghee has been used as cooking oil, an ingredient in dishes, and in Ayurveda therapies.It's rich in nutrients like bone-building calcium and has compounds linked to lower chances of obesity. Butter can also be part of a low-carbohydrate diet, which may help people better maintain their weight or lose weight quicker than they would with a low-fat diet.</i></p>

<b><i>Buiscuits</i></b>
<p><i>In most of the English-speaking world, a "biscuit" is a small, hard baked product that would be called either a "cookie" or a "cracker" in the United States and sometimes in Canada.The term biscuit comes to English from the French biscuit (bis-qui), which itself has a Latin root: panis biscotus refers to bread twice-cooked. The Romans certainly had a form of biscuit, what we'd now call a rusk and, as the name suggests, it was essentially bread which was re-baked to make it crisp.</i></p>

<br>
<b><i>Rusk</i></b>
<p><i>Rusk is just a dehydrated and sugar loaded version of bread, which is made tastier with a bunch of ingredients. The sweet flavour and subtle taste of rusk biscuits may appear healthy, but are loaded with trans fats, additives, sugar and gluten, which gradually may impact the metabolic health.They are calorie-dense and can quickly add up to your daily intake, leading to weight gain. One rusk can contain up to 40-60 calories, and it's easy to consume a handful without realizing the number of calories you're consuming.</i></p>
